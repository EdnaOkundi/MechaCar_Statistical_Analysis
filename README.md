# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Design specifications for MechaCar suspension coils dictates the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds 
per square inch (PSI).

The variance of the suspension coils for all three lots was 62.29. This is within MechaCar design specifications.

When examining the PSI of suspension coils in Lots 1, 2, and 3 individually, 
analysis indicated that the variance in Lots 1 and 2 are below 100 PSI, so suspension coils in Lots 1 and 2 are within MechaCar design 
specifications.

The variance for suspension coils in Lot 3 was 170.28, which exceeds MechaCar design specifications.

T-Tests on Suspension Coils
A one-sample t-test was used to determine whether or not if PSI across all manufacturing lots was statistically different from the 
population mean of 1500 PSI.

The distribution of the suspension coil dataset was visualized with a density plot, which showed that the suspension coil 
dataset was nearly evenly distributed.

For all t-tests conducted, the significance level was 0.05 percent. The t-test compared the means of the Suspension Coil dataset, 
which was 1498.78, against a mean of 1500. All t-tests conducted resulted in the means being statistically similar.

A t-test across all suspension coil manufacturing lots gave a p-value of 0.06 Since this is above the significance level, 
the two means are statistically similar.

A t-test for Lot 1 gave a p-value of 1, which is above the significance level. The two means are statistically similar.

The p-value for the Lot 2 t-test was 0.6072. This is above the significance level of 0.05 results in the two means being statistically similar.

The calculated p-value from the Lot 3 t-test was 0.4168. This is above the 0.05 significance level and results in the means being statistically similar.

  
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Description of Statistical Study
The cost of owning and maintaining a vehicle can be expensive, so AutosRUs wants to make sure their customers are getting the best value over their competitors and would like to measure the rate of depreciation for MechaCars against other manufacturers.

Metric
Rate of depreciation (value of vehicle over time)

Hypothesis
Null hypothesis: Rate of depreciation for MechaCars is equal to their competitors

Alternative hypothesis: Rate of depreciation for MechaCars is not equal to their competitors

Statistical test
Data analysts will use multiple linear regression to predict MechaCar's rate of depreciation
